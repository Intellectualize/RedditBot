# RedditBot

A Discord bot that fetches images from Reddit. It's really not that wild. Oh, it's written in Python.

## Setup

It's pretty easy.

- Download Python 3.6 **IMPORTANT, NOT 3.7+ DUE TO DISCORD.PY ISSUES**
- Download this repo in any method you feel like.
- Run `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder of this project.
- Run `py bot.py` in the bot's folder. Fill out the setup and you're good to go!
